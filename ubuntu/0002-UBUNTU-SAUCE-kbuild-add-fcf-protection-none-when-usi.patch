Subject: [PATCH 2/6] UBUNTU: SAUCE: kbuild: add -fcf-protection=none when
 using retpoline flags

BugLink: [Replace -fcf-protection=none patch with new version]

The gcc -fcf-protection=branch option is not compatible with
-mindirect-branch=thunk-extern. The latter is used when
CONFIG_RETPOLINE is selected, and this will fail to build with
a gcc which has -fcf-protection=branch enabled by default. Adding
-fcf-protection=none when building with retpoline support to
prevents such build failures.
