Subject: [PATCH 1/7] block, bfq: reduce upper bound for inject limit to
 max_rq_in_driver+1

Upon an increment attempt of the injection limit, the latter is
constrained not to become higher than twice the maximum number
max_rq_in_driver of I/O requests that have happened to be in service
in the drive. This high bound allows the injection limit to grow
beyond max_rq_in_driver, which may then cause max_rq_in_driver itself
to grow.

However, since the limit is incremented by only one unit at a time,
there is no need for such a high bound, and just max_rq_in_driver+1 is
enough.
